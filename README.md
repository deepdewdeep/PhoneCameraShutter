**Technical Insights:**

The Remote Mobile Camera Shutter is built upon the principles of BLE HID (Bluetooth Low Energy Human Interface Device). It relies on a range of libraries to create a Bluetooth keyboard that sends keypress events when a button is pressed and released. Here are some technical highlights:

- **BLE Library Integration:** The project utilizes various libraries for seamless interaction with BLE and HID devices, ensuring a robust and reliable connection.

- **BLE Server Callbacks:** Callback functions are defined to handle device connections and disconnections. When a device connects, it enables notifications on the input report, enhancing communication efficiency.

- **Output Callbacks:** The project manages data written to the output report, logging special keys received during operation.

- **taskServer Function:** This function serves as the core of the project. It initializes the BLE server, configures the HID device, defines the report map for the keyboard, and initiates advertising of the HID service. Additional settings such as manufacturer information, PnP ID, HID info, and security parameters are also established here.

- **setup Function:** The setup function is the heart of the Arduino setup routine. It initializes serial communication, configures the button pin as an input, attaches an interrupt to the button pin, sets up the LED pin, and creates a task to execute the taskServer function.

- **loop Function:** The loop function represents the primary execution loop of the project. It continuously checks if the button is pressed (btnFlag is set) and whether a BLE device is connected (connected is true). When both conditions are met, it emulates keypress events by manipulating values in the input report, notifies the change, briefly waits, and then releases the key. Visual feedback is provided through LED toggling.

- **pushButton Function (Interrupt Handler):** The pushButton function serves as an interrupt handler, responsible for setting the btnFlag when the button is pressed. It also detaches the interrupt to prevent multiple triggers.

In summary, the Remote Mobile Camera Shutter empowers you to redefine your mobile photography and videography experiences. With an extended wireless range, effortless remote control, and an open-source foundation, this project invites you to explore new horizons in smartphone content creation.

## Circuit Design and Component Selection

The circuit design of the Remote Mobile Camera Shutter combines efficiency, reliability, and low power consumption to deliver a compact and versatile solution for mobile photography enthusiasts. Here, I'll explore key components and design choices that make this project a reality.

### Power Supply with Li-Po Battery

The device is powered by a high-capacity 3.7V 802540 600mAh Li-Po battery, ensuring extended usage between charges. This lightweight and compact power source provides reliable energy for your photography and videography adventures. The power management circuitry efficiently utilizes the Li-Po battery's capacity while maintaining stable voltage levels.

### Power Regulation with TPS7A2033PDBVR

One of the critical components in the circuit is the **TPS7A2033PDBVR Low Dropout Regulator**. This regulator ensures stable and reliable power distribution throughout the system, regardless of the battery voltage. Key features of this regulator include:

- **Low Dropout Voltage:** The TPS7A2033PDBVR boasts a low dropout voltage, minimizing wasted energy and maximizing battery life, a crucial factor for extended usage without frequent recharging.

- **Efficiency:** The regulator's high efficiency contributes to overall power savings, making it an ideal choice for battery-powered applications.

- **Voltage Stability:** It maintains a stable output voltage, ensuring that the ESP32-WROOM-32D microcontroller and other components operate within their specified voltage range.

### ESP32-WROOM-32D Microcontroller

The heart of the Remote Mobile Camera Shutter is the **ESP32-WROOM-32D microcontroller**. This choice was made for several reasons:

- **Low Power Consumption:** The ESP32-WROOM-32D is known for its energy efficiency, making it suitable for battery-powered devices. It can operate in low-power modes, extending the device's runtime on a single charge.

- **Serial Programming:** Serial pins are used to program the microcontroller, allowing for easy firmware updates and customization.

## PCB Design

The PCB design of the Remote Mobile Camera Shutter is a testament to efficiency and compactness. I've carefully selected and integrated Surface Mount Device (SMD) components to optimize the device's size and performance. SMD components are renowned for their smaller form factor and reliability, making them ideal for projects where space is a premium.

**Key PCB Design Highlights:**

- **Compact Form Factor:** I've meticulously designed the PCB to minimize its footprint while maximizing functionality. The compact size ensures that the Remote Mobile Camera Shutter is easy to carry and integrate into your mobile photography setup.
